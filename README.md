# Spotify Song Popularity Data Analysis Project

## Abstract
This project aims to identify the key features that predict the popularity of songs on Spotify. I get the data set on Kaggle.com and I did the data cleaning and exploratory data analythis. Then, after building a null model, I employed generalized linear models for 3 different pooling method and with log transformation to examine the relationship between track popularity and a variety of predictors including playlist genre, playlist subgenre, and intrinsic audio features such as danceability, energy, acousticness, instrumentalness, liveness, duration, and age of the track. I use residual plot and AIC to compare the performance of different models. The analysis identifies significant predictors including playlist genre, subgenre, and various audio features. Notably, genres such as Latin, Pop, R&B, and Rap are positively correlated with popularity, while certain subgenres like ‘Electropop’ and ‘Gangster Rap’ show a negative association. Audio features such as danceability positively influence popularity, whereas energy and instrumentalness exhibit negative effects, suggesting a preference for vocal-driven and moderately energetic tracks. Moreover, shorter track durations and newer releases trend towards higher popularity, aligning with current listening preferences.The findings offer strategic insights for stakeholders in the music industry and highlight areas for further research in the evolving domain of digital music consumption.
